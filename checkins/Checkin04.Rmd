```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)

library(tidyselect)
housing_units <- readr::read_csv("https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2020/housing/HU-EST2020_ALL.csv")
```
1. Generate a line plot of the number of housing units in the entire United States from 2010 to 2020.
```{r}
# delete the extra year columns we do not need
# pivot the graph longer for year as name and housing unit is value
# change the year names to numeric
# plot a line graph for change in housing units over the year. 

house <- housing_units |>
  select(c(-HUESTIMATESBASE2010, -HUESTIMATE042020)) |>
  pivot_longer(contains("HUESTIMATE"),
               names_to = "Year",
               values_to = "Units") |>
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(stringr::str_sub(Year, start = 11))) 

ggplot(house,
       aes(Year, Units)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Years") +
  ylab("Housing Units") +
  ggtitle("Housing Units between 2010 and 2020") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(house$Year), max(house$Year), by = 1),1))
```

2. Generate a line plot of the number of housing units in each of the four regions (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) from 2010 to 2020, using a different color for each region.

```{r}
# create a subset that only contains the midwest, northeast, south, and west regions 
# plot a multi-lines graph and using different colors for the 4 regions. 

reg <- house |>
  subset(REGNAME == c("Northeast Region", "Midwest Region", "South Region", "West Region"))

ggplot( reg,
        aes(Year, Units, color = REGNAME)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Years") +
  ylab("Housing Units") +
  ggtitle("Housing Units between 2010 and 2020 By Regions") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(reg$Year), max(reg$Year), by = 1),1))
```
