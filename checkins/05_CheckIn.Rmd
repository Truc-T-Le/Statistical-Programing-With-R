1. (Project Euler Problem 1) The natural numbers less than 10 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these numbers is 23. Write R code to compute the sum of all the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 5.


```{r}
# create a loop to find every numbers less than 1000 
# check if number is divisible by either 3 or 5.
# append those numbers to an empty list was called y
# iterate to the next number up each time loop ran
# sum the numbers in the list called y

y <- c()
x <- 0
while (x < 1000) {
  if (x %% 3 == 0 | x %% 5 == 0) {
    y <- c(y, x)
    x <- x + 1
  } else {
    x <- x + 1
  }
}
total_y <- sum(y)
```

The sum of all the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 5 is `r total_y`
